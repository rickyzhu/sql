## patchsets.sh - used to compare applptch.txt to patchset listings from ARU.
##              - Curently Supports 10.7 - 11.5.10, R12.0.0
##              - Added R12 Support 2/12/07

##                         It is alot faster to go against ad_applied_patches
##                         but this only works if you are NOT using admrgpch to
##                         merge patchsets. Also, if providing your_file.csv
##                         the format is: 
##                         short_name, possible_patchset_number
##                         (The short_name is not used but a value is required)
##                          available=metalink - defaults to all patchsets even
##                          if not available for download from metalink.

## WARNING: 
##   If you use it be careful to first BACKUP your $HOME/.netrc 
##   The program should not touch that file, as long as you are not

##   FEEDBACK WELCOME!!! - Steve.Andrew@oracle.com
##
##        if problems: Please run with debug=y appended and email me

##
## Note1: The connect string is required if > 11.5.4 or the latest AD
##        patch has been applied. (See README.txt on ftp site)
##
## Note2: The applptch= is not required if your APPL_TOP is set. The
##        program will find it based on the standard locations.
##        If you use the htmlout= option, the program will generate an
##        html file format that can be redirected to a web location so
##        that the tool can easily make the report available to your 
##        Enterprise.
##
## Note3: Optional CUST_TEMP variable can be used to set the TEMP out 
##        directory where temp files are created as the program runs.
##
## Note4: Product HZ not currently showing in the report. If you want it
##        you can add: HZ to the APPLFULL or APPLSHAR env. variables before
##        running the program. - Should have a table fixed for this...
##
## Note5: If having a "Arg list too long" problem on AIX, try: aix=y option
##        This will run slower, but should eliminate the 
##         ./patchsets.sh: line 1136: /bin/grep: cannot execute [Arg list
##        too long]
##
## Note6: Generally should work on any platform with ksh or sh. Recently fixed
##        a PSEUDO products sh problem. 4.23  No other known issues currently
##        with shells.

## CHANGE LOG / HISTORY:
###############################################################################
## 4/10/00- Intial Release by Steve Andrew 
## 8/07/00- Added 11i Support, Base Patchsets (11.5.1) still a bit confused
##          appears that several patchsets "A" are applied by the 11.5.1 
##          upgrade
## 1/11/01- Modified significantly from ckpatch.sh used with the web
##          only version. This is used as a standalone script or can
##          be built from a web front-end to add the dynmamic data
##          to it from ARU. A cron generates this info. via sqlplus
## 3/23/01- Adding htmlout=file option to build the output in html format
##          if desired. Also added silent=y
## 5/09/01- Martin Fitzgerald from Consulting contributed the Report_11i.txt
##          report which is more detailed for 11i.
##          Also limited the General report(Report.txt) to only show the
##          APPLFULL and APPLSHAR products IF these variables are set. 
##          Also updated the Header to reflect IF APPLFULL was used to
##          Limit the Product Patchset listing. 
## 5/31/01- Removed Martin Fitzgerald Name from Report_11i.txt per request.
## 6/26/01- Added support for 11.5.4 including the 1154_Base.txt file which
##          includes the baseline listing of all the patchsets from the README.
## Version: 2.0
## 10/3/01- Adding support for 11.5.5 or latest AD patch where patches have
##          been moved into the RDBMS in tables AD_BUGS etc...
## Version: 2.1
## 10/24/01 Checking for presents of typeset command in the shell and 
##          warning if not present. This command is used in the Report_11i.txt
##          but does not cause the report.txt report to fail. 
##          - Not fixed yet, but run
##          ksh on Solaris and it will work. 
## 10/25/01 - Fixed by removing typeset -l and using tr to force 
##          APPLFULL/APPLSHAR products to all lower case. 
## Version: 2.2
## 11/2/01 - Found problem with some Versions in Header of applptch.txt 
##          added some traps to skip if version has 11.x.x\r\n  
##          - case statement 11.x.x*)  fix.
## Version: 2.3
##          AIX had a grep buffer overrun when > 2k size a fix was to put the
##          string in quotes before calling a grep see: AIX
##          1) Install X11.dt.rte on AIX (this gave me /usr/dt/bin/dtksh 
##             version 93 of ksh)
##          2) I modified your script (just a little)
##             add: #!/usr/dt/bin/dtksh (as the first line of the script)
##          3) Running the script then no longer had the
##            ./patchsets.sh[57]: 0403-029
##          Tip: To check the current shell version: Esc Cntrl-V
## Version: 2.4 
##          Added some MKS specific error dif. commands who am i vs. whoami
##           andtput fails to work. Also checking for the /tmp directory 
##          and making sending message to create if not present 
##          - on current drive when running on NT.
##          Also worked out the sqlplus connection issues on NT via MSK for
##          the new AD_BUGS. Documentation added to help on how to run it
##          under NT/MKS. (Env sourcing etc..)
## Version: 2.5
##          Added a feature to be able to run against 10.7 NCA (nca=y)
##          Fixed a problem running against 10sc files.
## Version: 2.6
##          Added support for 11.5.6 which only shows up on Oracle Internal
##          OHS Systems because fnd_product_groups does not get updated when
##          the 11.5.6 ERP or CRM Patch is applied. The 11.5.6 Patchsets
##          Baseline is created as /tmp/1156_Base.txt
##          Also secured the sqlplus password from ps snoops
## Version: 2.7
##          Added ability for 11i installs using the database to store patch 
##          history to search just the patches applied(ad_applied_patches) 
##          instead of all included bugs(ad_bugs) see: option patch_list=
## Version: 2.8
##          Updated to handle the new AD_BUGS structure that is no longer using
##          APPLICATION_SHORT_NAME . Found problem with a customer doing a 10.7
##          upgrade to 11i. The existing apps installs seem to still have the
##          table, but it would no longer be up-dated either.
## Version: 2.9
##          Updated to handle the new 11.5.7 Maintainence Pack or patchsets
## Version: 3.0 
##          Fixed 8.05 sqlplus background connection with a space in front of here now.
##          Fixed DOMAIN error when on NT no /etc/resolv... file.
##          Found a way that some aru's without actions were not showing the patch in patch.csv
##          when using the applptch.txt file. Fixed by appending an grep begin aru"
## Version: 3.1
##          Added tool version to Report Header, Help, etc.
## Version: 3.2
##          Apparently introduced a problem in the Generation of the Patch.csv in the 3.0 
##          revision when customers are using applptch.txt.
##          Has to do with appending: grep "begin aru bug" $applptch .. not just "begin bug"
##          Currently investigating further..
##          Fix: Needed to remove a space in the Patch.csv output Short,Bug not Short, Bug
## Version: 3.3
##          Added more patchsets to the ARU generated 11i_patchsets.txt file so that to fix a
##          problem in the "Installed Version" and possibly "Running Version" of the Report_11i.txt
##          Also changed the header from: "Installed Version" to "Baseline Version" to make it clearer.
## Version: 3.4 
##          Added the Family Packs listing as a separate section to the Report.txt report. Also enhanced
##          the explanation on the report about patchsets included in Family packs and the Distribution
##          of such.
## Version: 3.5 
##          Added 11.5.8 Support, ie. uses: /tmp/1158_Base.txt to establish the baseline for 11.5.8
##          Also need to fix the APPLFULL and APPLSHAR to come from the database once AUTOCONFIG
##          is enabled since the env variables are not set any more...once AUTOCONFIG is setup.
##          => KNOWN ... issue, not fixed yet. Workaround, set them yourself! APPLFULL and APPLSHAR
##          select fav.application_short_name Short, fpi.status Status
##          from fnd_application_vl fav, fnd_product_installations fpi
##          where fav.application_id = fpi.application_id and 
##          fav.application_short_name NOT like 'SYSADMIN' and
##          fpi.status != 'N' 
##          order by 2,1;
## Version: 3.6 
##          Added new 11.5.7 Baseline and fixed APPLFULL and APPSHAR for autoconfig cusomters
##          ie. The program builds and sets the APPLFULL and APPLSHAR env from database tables.
##          see: Set_APPLFULL_APPLSHAR_from_DB
##          Also enhanced Report.txt to use the FULL Baseline patchsets listing as the
##          Report_11i.txt does. This limits the person from having to look at the Basline
##          release patchsets to build their true baseline.
##          Appended the 11.5.7 patchsets not included in ad_bugs but in the 
##          fnd_installed_products table to the 1157_Base.txt file. This is a merge of
##          the html Release Notes and that tables listing. Still appears some products
##          proper true baselines are missing. ie. ad is not in either location.
##          Speeded up the Report.txt file using a diff -c ... may cause problems on some
##          Unixs if that option isn't present. If so use old way or: new_compare=n option
## Version: 3.7
##          Modified the Patch.csv list to include ad_applied_patches as well as ad_bugs.
##          Also limit the ad_bugs part of the listing for 11.5.7 and 11.5.8 to only bugs added
##          after 01-JAN-2002. This solved an NT bug that ran out of memory. This also
##          solved the extremely LONG running problem due to ad_bugs being ~40k records
##          when released with 11.5.7 and 11.5.8 (bugs logged on this).
##          This is still showing ~26000 bugs with 11.5.8, and they end ~Oct 29,2002 if I
##          want to change the sql to exclude them to make the query faster. The only
##          advantage is that is may show some patchset history ... but not really required
##          since I have merged the 1158_Base.txt with html release note and 
##          fnd_product_installations patchset listings.
##          Cleaned up some of the format issues on the Report_11i report as it goes to screen
##          and file. Have not tested changes for NT which ignores these screen output attr.
## Version: 3.8 
##          Added option for CUST_TEMP variable to point at the OUT_DIR or temp files
##          directory. If not set, the program still defaults to /tmp. Also purged some tmp files
##          that were not being removed. The only files that should be left at this point would
##          be the reports that get created in the current directory and any supporting ARU
##          data files. ie. /tmp/11i_patchsets.txt & /tmp/115X_Base.txt files.
##          Also cleanup the files not used for their install: 10.7, 11.0, or 115X in OUT_DIR.
##          Still leave all the 115X_Base if an 11i install. They are used.              
## Version: 3.9  
##          Fixed OFA => FA when using fnd_applications_vl, and added a date > option for ad_bugs
##          as a work-around for an NT customer have variable limits with MKS
## Date: 1/30/2003
## Version: 4.0 
##          1) New Option: override_appsversion=11.5.[x] where customer can overide the default
##          Lookup of their core apps version(FND_PRODUCT_GROUPS) used for the baselines.
##          2) Included Patches Applied from: ad_patch_driver_minipks, translated but numbers from
##          ARU listing 11i_patchsets.txt, then append to the Patch.csv as part of customer applied.
## Date: 2/3/2003 
## Version: 4.1 - see bug: 2743473, Issue - 4. (Issues - 1 unix env doesn't match prod tables., 
##          Issue - 3 (OFA=>FA) Not-a-bug)
##          4.02) was not showing up in the Report_11i.txt report, only the Report.txt report.
##          FIXED. Has to do with examples like: Family Pack: 11i.FIN_PF.C(2380068) which
##          included 11i.AP.J (2375849)  which only shows up in ad_patch_dirver_minipks.
##          Bug: Left out a comma when appending the patchsets from: Applied_Ad_Minipks.csv
##          to Patch.csv - Note: The date format is dif. in field one as a way to tell them
##          appart.
##          Bug 2743473, Issue - 2 - HZ product not showing up. Fixed with a Work-Around by
##          setting the UNIX env either APPLFULL or APPLSHAR to have HZ in them. This will
##          merge it into the list created from the database tables. FND_APPLICATION_TL etc.
##          OPEN ISSUE: Should not the HZ "Trading Partners" patchsets be part of AR since
##          their objects appear to be owned by AR. - Check with: MineOdok (internal AIM..)
## Date: 2/7/2003 
## Version: 4.2 
##          still relates to bug: 2743473, Issue - 4. 
##          (Issues - 1 unix env doesn't match prod tables., 
##          Had a code logic problem in checking for "HZ " vs "HZ" in the grep
##          - so adding HZ only worked if it had a space at the end. Fixed!
##
## Date: 2/10/2003 
## Version: 4.3
##          Relates to bug: 2743473, Issue - 4. 
##          (Issues - 1 unix env doesn't match prod tables., 
##          Changed to HARD-CODE "HZ" into the APPLFULL listing 
##          until we get this fixed internally. Philippe G. has the bug... 
##         - Means it will just show up in the Products FULL listings reports.
##         - No need to Add it to the unix applfull or applshar before running.
##
## Date: 2/10/2003 
## Version: 4.4
##         The SHARED FULL Products where not showing up with
##         a system that had sqlplus settings odd. Fixed by
##         changing the SQL to make SHORT_NAME STATUS be on one line.
## Date: 7/22/2003 
## Version: 4.5
##          Added support for 11.5.9
##
## Date: 9/29/2003 
## Version: 4.6
##          Added support for AIX "Arg list too long" problem
##          Work-Around: aix=y on command line and writes array to file
##          instead of using the faster in-memory way.
##
## Date: 9/29/2003 
## Version: 4.7
##          Financials Family Pack 11i.FIN_PF.D 2629235 was released
##          with 11.5.9 and is not showing up. This was because DEV
##          removed it from ARU database and it no longer shows up in 
##          the 11i_patchsets.txt nightly output. It is in the 1159_Base.txt
##          SOLUTION: Append a record to the 11i_patchsets.txt as
##          follows:
##          fin_pf 11i.FIN_PF.D 2629235 14-MAY-01 Patchset Closed Not_Distributed
##          I did this in the ARU Data sql, not in my code. No change in this code.
##
## Date: 1/06/2004
## Version: 4.8
##          Financials Family Pack 11i.FIN_PF.D 2629235 NOT showing up
##          This is because the report_11i.txt did a grep -v Closed on the
##          Family Packs _pf. Hope this doesnt show Family Packs with Higher
##          value that WONT be available. Put in fix, removed the grep -v Closed
##         
## Date: 05/10/2004
## Version: 4.9
##          Had another AIX issue where the new shell still didnt fix
##          the memory problem noted in the help. Added a work-around with 
##          the aix=y option in the Run_SQL procedure.
##          $ EscCnrl-V -> Generates the version:
##          $ Version M-11/16/88i
## 
## Date: 06/17/2004
## Version: 4.10
##          11.0.X runs the Report_11i.txt and shows errors Sun/Hp at least 
##          < if [ "${R11i:=YES}" = "YES" ]; then
##          --- > Changed and added in the database section R11i=YES

##
## Date: 10/20/2004
## Version: 4.11
##          Modified Report.txt and Report_11i.txt to only show Metalink

##          means that if they dont have "By_Metalink" in the distribution
##          column, they will only be used to get baselines, and check applied
##          but will not show up on the Latest Available areas of the reports.
##          This was reported as a problem when lots of 11.5.10 patchsets
##          were being created but not on metalink, just before 11.5.10 rel.
##          Once 11.5.10 is out, most of those patchsets will have a dist. 
##          of Metalink, but currently caused some confusion on the report.
##          For code change locations see: FIX LATEST AVAILABLE
##
## Date: 11/29/2004
## Version: 4.12
##          Removed support for: 10sc, 10.7 and 10.7NCA. 
##          PS: Plan to add: 11.5.10 support soon in 4.13
##
## Date: 01/03/2005
## Version: 4.13
##          Added back support for: 10.7 and 10.7NCA. 
##          Added: 11.5.10 support as planned.
##
## Date: 03/03/2005
## Version: 4.14
##          1) Found problem with connect=apps/xxx when an applptch.txt file  
##          is present. It was using the applptch.txt file. Setup_Env()
##          2) Added option to show only LATEST AVAILABLE: on metalink
##          (see: 4.11 change), with: latest=metalink else it now shows
##          the latest available followed by the status REL-SOURCE.
##          3) Also added: Pseudo Products to the  Reports which are products
##          not in the FND_ tables. 
##          4) Added fix for AIX Memory issue which doesnt require the
##          aix=y flag any more. Send Variable data for file instead
##
## Date: 03/24/2005
## Version: 4.15
##          1) Found problem with PSEUDO products in if someone
##          sets a dif. default OUTPUT directory than /tmp. 
##          ie. CUST_TEMP=/myhome  assumed /tmp/11i_patchsets.txt
##
## Date: 03/29/2005
## Version: 4.16
##          ADDED OAM so to PSEUDO PRODUCT Listing
##
## Date: 03/31/2005
## Version: 4.17
##          4.16 didnt work as expected and changed it AND TESTED
##          the change this time. OAM showed up in the PSEUDO PRODUCTS
##          list on the Report.txt and OAM.G showed as applied.
##
## Date: 04/07/2005
## Version: 4.18
##          Still had an awk variable problem with AIX and some
##          hard coded references to /tmp have been removed so that
##          CUST_TEMP can be used at command line or set first.
##
## Date: 04/18/2005
## Version: 4.19
##          If not passing connect= on command line R11i=YES wasnt 
##          getting set. Problem happend from a code change above.
##
## Date: 04/19/2005
## Version: 4.20
##          Added Test upgrade=. or upgrade=/tmp to update from ftp
##          site automatically.
##
## Date: 07/27/2005
## Version: 4.21
##          Fixed NT memory problems shell cant fit large variable
##          strings with MKS like AIX see aix fixes.
##
## Date: 09/26/2005
## Version: 4.22
##          Back Fixed the 10.7 data files not showing up.
##
## Date: 12/20/2005
## Version: 4.23
##          Had a /bin/sh vs /bin/ksh problem on Solaris with
##          PSEUDO Products not working. Added: tmpPSEUDOBack tmp
##          file to fix loop export variable shell issu.
##          (ARU Changed data structure which effected short name
##          during this same time frame)
##
## Date: 01/03/2006
## Version: 4.24
##          Thanks to james.sargent@oracle.com added code changes
##          that dramatically increased the speed of the application.
##          PS: Have continuted to put off database version that
##          runs in seconds because OAM has in the past said there
##          version would include patch history. Still considering!
##          Email me if this is a priority for you. Would use xml
##          dataload, then select patchxml_list minus 
##          select your applied query. Runs very fast.
##
## Date: 02/23/2006
## Version: 4.25
##          Added DNA to FULL Products for SHARED to show correctly
##
## Date: 10/30/2006
## Version: 4.26
##          Updated to point to new ftp site and updated the auto
##          upgrade to: ftp.oracle.com
##
## Date: 11/14/2006
## Version: 4.27
##          Change suggested by: Ronald.rademaker@oracle.com
##          dif. syntax for uname on Cygwin, workaround see OS1
##
## Date: 11/15/2006
## Version: 4.28
##          Found problem with uname -o syntax on Sun from above
##          Reworked and added fix for CUST_TEMP being null on cygwin
##          and corrected DOMAIN instead of workgroup on NT
##
## Date: 11/17/2006
## Version: 4.29
##          Added support for htmlout11i=Path for the Report_11i.txt to
##          be output to html as well as htmlout for Report.txt.
##          Also fixed another problem with CUST_TEMP
##
## Date: 02/12/07 
## Version: 4.31
##          Started working on R12 support and broke something and needed
##          to move OUT_FILE variable above moved Get_DB_Apps_Version.
##
## Date: 02/12/07 
## Version: 4.32
##          First working version of R12. May need some changes.
##
## Date: 02/14/07 
## Version: 4.33
##          Added to R11i section, after moving it above in 4.32
##          to support R12, missed for 11i and caused no APPLFULL and
##          APPLSHAR variables to be set for 11i 
##          Set_APPLFULL_APPLSHAR_from_DB
##
## Date: 05/09/07 
## Version: 4.34
##          BASELINE.txt file ended up with more than just the baseline
##          so some people wanted to use the BASELINE.txt file for other
##          purposes. fix created a BASELINE.tmp for the purposes my code
##          needed it.
##
## Date: 06/04/07 
## Version: 4.35
##          Added Applied_Patches reports: Applied_Patches_11i.txt or
##          Applied_Patches_R12.txt in on R12 - They get created by 
##          default and put in the same directory as the patchset
##          reports.
##
## Date: 11/27/07 
## Version: 4.37
##          Problem when 11i.ADX.F 3453499 has been applied, but the 
##          11i.ADX.E.1 patch showed as the active because it has a higher
##          bug number. Odd situation, so I just hard coded a fix.
## Date: 11/28/07 
## Version: 4.38
##          Added message: {product} has no patchsets!
##          for Products like IZU that have not released patchsets.
##
## Date: 01/07/08 
## Version: 4.39
##          Trapping ORACLE_HOME not set in Run_SQL to be easier for people
##          that have not setup the env. instead of bunch errors to the screen.
##
## Date: 02/06/08 
## Version: 4.40
##          Fixed odd error when applptch.txt file is missing for 10.7/11.0.X
##          like a fresh install. fix: add on command line: 
##          patchsets.sh version=10.7.0|11.0.1(2,3) and it will not prompt for
##          database user password. Use to assume if no applptch.txt, its 11i/R12.
##          Also, Debug function was failing if OUT_DIR was not set, so default
##          to current directory "." before checking for CUST_TEMP env. setting.
##
## Date: 02/06/08 
## Version: 4.41
##          Had a bad sql column in Applied Patches report for 11.5.10.2
##          
## Date: 06/02/09 
## Version: 4.42
##          Added support for R12.1.1 release by adding 1211_Base.txt file
##          when the release is 12.1.1 as the base listing of applied.
##          see: R1211_PATCHES variable in program to better understand.
##
## Date: 06/03/09 
## Version: 4.43
##          Missed a change to support the R12.1.1 patchsets baseline and
##          limited the Patch.csv report size and update R12 Report.
##
## Date: 06/09/09 
## Version: 4.44
##          Fixed syntax on R12.sql report and added Test merge R12 report
##
## Date: 06/10/09 
## Version: 4.45
##          TOOL_VERSION was only working and showing on report if run from
##          same directory because it greped directly on patchsets.sh. 
##          Hard coded instead. New R12 merge report isn't quite working
##          so removing until further investigation. Adding only as a
##          standalone report. report=merged
##
## Date: 06/24/09 
## Version: 4.46
##          Just added optional rename or move report at the end to support
##          people running against multiple instances from same location or
##          cron.
##          ie. patchsets.sh connect=apps/apps \
##              report_name=${TWO_TASK}_Report_R12.txt
##
## Date: 07/08/09 
## Version: 4.47
##          Changed output format spacing on columns so it is easier to 
##          import report_xx.txt into Excel, columns line up better per
##          User request.
##
## Date: 03/03/10 
## Version: 4.48
##          Just minor changes on a few spellings and LAST_MODIFIED was
##          added as a variable to make it easier to show consistently.
##
## Date: 02/09/11 
## Version: 4.49
##          Modified R12 SQL Report to include  in ('SQLAP', 'SQLGL' )
##
## Date: 02/22/11 
## Version: 4.50
##          Modified R12 SQL Report changed substring to substr
##          
## Date: 03/11/11 
## Version: 4.51
##          Changed status from Che-Released to Patch-Released on Reports
##          Report_11i.txt and Report_R12.txt 
##
## Date: 05/05/11 
## Version: 4.52
##          Adding 1212_Base.txt and 1213_Base.txt baseline support for
##          R12.1.2 and R12.1.3 releases.

TO RUN UNDER NT with MKS:
1) Get to the drive where the appl_top is.
   C:> D:
   D:\\>
   Make a tmp directory on that drives root.
   D:> mkdir tmp (this is where the patchset lists get created)

2) cd to the APPL_TOP path   and
   then execute the envshell to setup the env variables.
   D:\\> cd D:\\\apps\\\visappl
   D:\\\apps\\\visappl> envshell
  -> A new window spawns with the correct env settings, use it for step 3
3) Start the MKS SHELL,
   D:\\\apps\\\visappl> sh
   $
4) Run the patchsets program from the APPL_TOP/admin/$ORACLE_SID directory
   $ cd $APPL_TOP/admin/VIS
   $ ./patchsets.sh applptch=applptch.txt

   After the update from IBM, then the Esc Control-V should
   show at least: Version M-11/16/93i
2) Modified the script:

3) Running the script then no longer had the

IF AIX GIVES: [Arg list too long], try Work-Around in V. 4.6 release:
## Date: 9/29/2003
1) patchsets.sh aix=y [then normal arguments...]
   NOTE: Removed the need for aix=y V. 4.14.

AIX Summary: You will very likely need the aix=y option and the new shell.
V. 4.14 - Fixed so that it should work without the new shell or the aix=y
   option.

WARNING: Relationship between patchsets and family packs:
   The report may say that the highest patchset installed is: B, but if a
   Family Pack was installed that includes that Product, then the Family Pack
   could have a higher version of that particular product. The program should
   pick up patchsets applied by Family Packs.

   If the most recently available patchset is not available on metalink
   for download, then you can run the report with available=metalink to limit
   the available patchsets to those that are on Metalink.

   Note: Family packs are generally used to bundle many patchsets today and
   this is the way that you can get the latest available patchsets. There 
   are also new Consolidated Updates (CU) that have recently been created.
   ~2/2005
   There is a Consolidated Update for all the products:
   ####################################################################
   3240000 - 11.5.10 ORACLE E-BUSINESS SUITE CONSOLIDATED UPDATE 1 AND
   There is a one for the ATG product family:
   4017300 - 11.5.10 Consolidated Update (CU1) for ATG Product Family.
   3460000 - 11.5.10 Oracle E-Business Suite Consolidated Update 2 (CU2)
   see Note: 316366.1, includes other CU2 patches: 4125550 ATG_PF, 
   4328839 AD, 4325353 ADX, 4268805 CRM, 4247648 FIN_PF, 4306532 HR_PF 
   If you have any questions on this, please log a SR.

NOTE:  TXK patches are delivered by 11i.ATG_PF.x and no longer as 
       patchsets, but as one off rollups. ie. Only TXK.A and TXK.B were
       delivered as patchsets. ie. 11i.TXK.B is in 11i.ATG_PF.H

WARNING on Family Packs and Patchsets:
   The patchsets included in a Family Pack are not all distributed as standalone, but
   should show up in ad_bugs as an included patch.  These were not included
   in the Report because they were not downloadable directly from Metalink. This has
   caused some confusion in the real Baseline or Running patchsets because you had to
   determine that based on the readme of your Family Packs that have been applied.
   This has been changed and the patchsets in ${OUT_DIR}/11i_patchsets.txt now includes all
   the patchsets even if they are not standalone and you cannot get them as one offs.
   See the new Status field in the Latest Available column. or check /tmp/11i_patchsets.txt.

Please check Metalink for final patchset availability questions and Distribution Status issues:

Note1:
   Latest Available:  This may be Distributed via Metalink as standalone or only by a Family Pack.
   Until release 3.3 of this script, the Installed Version only included Standalone release patchesets
   and not any of the patchsets included in Family Packs.

Note2: (as of v.4.14)
  Latest Available shows all patchsets even if NOT AVAILABLE for download on
  Metalink. An optional flag to limit Latest Available to patches only available
  on metailink has been provided. ie. Add: available=metalink to command line.

Note3: 
   TXK patches are delivered by 11i.ATG_PF. RUPxyz and no longer as 
   patchsets, but as one off rollups. ie. Only TXK.A and TXK.B were
   delivered as patchsets.

WARNING on Family Packs and Patchsets:
   Things have changed in R12 with Code Levels and Code Lines. 
   A report: Applied_Patches_R12.txt is also included that shows all of your applied
   patches along with the Codelevels for all products (including pseudo), and 
   family_packs. The Codelevels are stored in a new table called:
   ad_trackable_entities.
   Patches are no longer unique in that the same patch number can be released
   more than once but at different code levels.   
   Patchsets included in a Family Pack are not all distributed as standalone, but
   should show up in ad_bugs as an included patch. 
   The patchsets in ${OUT_DIR}/R12_patchsets.txt includes all the patchsets even if 
   they are not standalone and you cannot get them as one offs.
   See the new Status field in the Latest Available column. or check 
   /tmp/R12_patchsets.txt.
   Also note: Patch.csv is not a complete list of all the patches, but only those 
   applied after the 01-JAN-07 release date and if on 12.1.1 or higher 01-JAN-09.

Please check Metalink for final patchset availability questions and Distribution Status issues:

Note1:
   Latest Available:  This may be Distributed via Metalink as standalone or only by a Family Pack.
   Until release 3.3 of this script, the Installed Version only included Standalone release patchesets
   and not any of the patchsets included in Family Packs.

Note2: (as of v.4.14)
